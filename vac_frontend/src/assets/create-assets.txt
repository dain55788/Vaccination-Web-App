We need to create the following image assets for our app:

1. vaccination.png - A main image for the landing page showing a vaccination scenario
2. vaccine-icon.png - An icon representing a vaccine for listing available vaccines

Since we can't directly create image files here, you should add appropriate image files to the src/assets directory. 

For now, you might encounter errors related to missing images. You can either:
1. Add your own image files to the src/assets directory
2. Temporarily comment out the Image components until you add the images
3. Use placeholder services like https://via.placeholder.com/ with the Image component
